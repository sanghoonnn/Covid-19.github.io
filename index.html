        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p><a href="">COVID-19</a> Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by a virus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.[5] The disease quickly spread worldwide, resulting in the COVID-19 pandemic.
        
        <strong>symptoms of COVID-19</strong> The Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable but often include fever,[6] cough, headache,[7] fatigue, breathing difficulties, loss of smell, and loss of taste.[8][9][10] Symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms.</p>

        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <p>The symptoms of COVID-19 are variable depending on the type of variant contracted, ranging from mild symptoms to a potentially fatal illness. Common symptoms include coughing, fever, loss of smell (anosmia) and taste (ageusia), with less common ones including headaches, nasal congestion and runny nose, muscle pain, sore throat, diarrhea, eye irritation, and toes swelling or turning purple, and in moderate to severe cases, breathing difficulties. People with the COVID-19 infection may have different symptoms, and their symptoms may change over time. Three common clusters of symptoms have been identified: one respiratory symptom cluster with cough, sputum, shortness of breath, and fever; a musculoskeletal symptom cluster with muscle and joint pain, headache, and fatigue; and a cluster of digestive symptoms with abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. In people without prior ear, nose, or throat disorders, loss of taste combined with loss of smell is associated with COVID-19 and is reported in as many as 88% of symptomatic cases

        <p>COVID-19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2' (SARS-CoV-2).</p>
        <h4>Transmission</h4>
        <p>COVID-19 is mainly transmitted when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets/aerosols and small airborne particles containing the virus. Infected people exhale those particles as they breathe, talk, cough, sneeze, or sing. Transmission is more likely the more physically close people are. However, infection can occur over longer distances, particularly indoors.
        </p>
        <p>Infectivity can begin four to five days before the onset of symptoms,[63] although contact tracing typically begins only two to three days before symptom onset. Infected people can spread the disease even if they are pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic. Most commonly, the peak viral load in upper respiratory tract samples occurs close to the time of symptom onset and declines after the first week after symptoms begin. Current evidence suggests a duration of viral shedding and the period of infectiousness of up to ten days following symptom onset for people with mild to moderate COVID-19, and up to 20 days for persons with severe COVID-19, including immunocompromised people.            
        </p>
        <p>Infectious particles range in size from aerosols that remain suspended in the air for long periods of time to larger droplets that remain airborne briefly or fall to the ground.[66][67][68][69] Additionally, COVID-19 research has redefined the traditional understanding of how respiratory viruses are transmitted.[69][70] The largest droplets of respiratory fluid do not travel far, but can be inhaled or land on mucous membranes on the eyes, nose, or mouth to infect.[68] Aerosols are highest in concentration when people are in close proximity, which leads to easier viral transmission when people are physically close,[68][69][70] but airborne transmission can occur at longer distances, mainly in locations that are poorly ventilated;[68] in those conditions small particles can remain suspended in the air for minutes to hours.[68]
        </p>
        <p>The number of people generally infected by one infected person varies,[71] but it is estimated that the R0 ("R nought" or "R zero") number is around 2.5.[72] The disease often spreads in clusters, where infections can be traced back to an index case or geographical location.[73] Often in these instances, superspreading events occur, where many people are infected by one person.
        </p>
        <h4>Virology</h4>
        <p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.[74] All structural features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus particle occur in related coronaviruses in nature.[75]
        </p>
        <p>Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.
        </p>
        <p>SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.[77] It is thought to have an animal (zoonotic) origin. Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains. It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).[78][79][80] The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include membrane glycoprotein (M), envelope protein (E), nucleocapsid protein (N), and the spike protein (S). The M protein of SARS-CoV-2 is about 98% similar to the M protein of bat SARS-CoV, maintains around 98% homology with pangolin SARS-CoV, and has 90% homology with the M protein of SARS-CoV; whereas, the similarity is only around 38% with the M protein of MERS-CoV.
        </p>
        <h4>SARS-CoV-2</h4>
        <p>The many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 variants are grouped into either clades or lineages.[82][83] The WHO, in collaboration with partners, expert networks, national authorities, institutions and researchers, have established nomenclature systems for naming and tracking SARS-CoV-2 genetic lineages by GISAID, Nextstrain and Pango. The expert group convened by the WHO recommended the labelling of variants using letters of the Greek alphabet, for example, Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Gamma, giving the justification that they "will be easier and more practical to discussed by non-scientific audiences."[84] Nextstrain divides the variants into five clades (19A, 19B, 20A, 20B, and 20C), while GISAID divides them into seven (L, O, V, S, G, GH, and GR).[85] The Pango tool groups variants into lineages, with many circulating lineages being classed under the B.1 lineage.            
        </p>
        <p>
        Several notable variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerged throughout 2020.[87][88] Cluster 5 emerged among minks and mink farmers in Denmark.[89] After strict quarantines and a mink euthanasia campaign, the cluster was assessed to no longer be circulating among humans in Denmark as of 1 February 2021.
        </p>
        <p>
        As of December 2021, there are five dominant variants of SARS-CoV-2 spreading among global populations: the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7, formerly called the UK variant), first found in London and Kent, the Beta variant (B.1.351, formerly called the South Africa variant), the Gamma variant (P.1, formerly called the Brazil variant), the Delta variant (B.1.617.2, formerly called the India variant),[91] and the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529), which had spread to 57 countries as of 7 December.
